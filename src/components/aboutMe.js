In my fifteen years in the corporate events industry, this was a question I asked myself at every opportunity, pioneering cross-company initiatives using self-taught technology to streamline business processes and improve the customer and employee experience. Itâ€™s a question I continue to ask myself as I follow a long-held passion for web development and creative design, recently retraining as a Web Developer with an emphasis on front-end and an interest in UX/UI.</p>
